# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Start Commands

- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Runs Next.js dev server on port 3008
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Production build
- **Lint**: `npm lint` - Run ESLint
- **Start**: `npm run start` - Start production server

## Project Overview

This is a Miro-like collaborative whiteboard application built with Next.js 15. It enables real-time collaborative drawing and shape editing with multiple users.

## Architecture

### Core Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Liveblocks (for presence, multiplayer sync) + Convex (backend database)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **State Management**: Zustand (UI modals), Liveblocks Storage (canvas state)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Canvas State Management
The canvas operates through a state machine defined in `src/types/canvas.ts:35-43`:

```
CanvasMode: None | Pressing | SelectionNet | Translating | Inserting | Resizing | Pencil
```

Each mode represents a distinct interaction state (e.g., drawing, selecting, moving objects). The main Canvas component (`src/app/board/[boardId]/_components/canvas.tsx:59`) manages these state transitions through pointer events.

#### 2. Layer System
- **Layers** are drawable objects (Rectangle, Ellipse, Path, Text, Note) defined in `src/types/canvas.ts:56-134`
- Stored in Liveblocks Storage as `LiveMap<string, LiveObject<Layer>>` for real-time sync
- Layer rendering is abstracted into individual layer components (`src/app/board/[boardId]/_components/layers/*.tsx`)
- Each layer has position (x, y), dimensions (width, height), and fill color

#### 3. Real-time Collaboration Flow
- **Storage Layer**: Liveblocks manages `layers` (LiveMap) and `layerIds` (LiveList)
- **Presence Layer**: Tracks user cursor position, selection state, and pencil draft
- **Mutations**: Use `useMutation` hook to broadcast changes to all connected clients
- **Sync**: Changes are automatically persisted and distributed via Liveblocks

#### 4. Persistence & Database
- **Convex** handles board metadata (title, orgId, author info) in `convex/schema.ts`
- Board metadata queries: `convex/boards.ts:6-74` (with search and favorites support)
- Canvas layers/shapes are ephemeral and stored only in Liveblocks (not persisted to DB)
- User favorites stored in `userFavorites` table with multi-field indices

### Component Organization

```
src/app/(dashboard)/          # Dashboard/board list pages
src/app/board/[boardId]/      # Canvas editor page
  _components/
    canvas.tsx               # Main canvas state machine & event handling
    layer-preview.tsx        # Renders individual layers
    layers/                  # Layer-specific renderers (rect, ellipse, path, text, note)
    toolbar.tsx              # Tool selection UI
    selection-tools.tsx      # Color picker & properties for selected objects
src/components/              # Reusable components
  ui/                        # Radix UI wrapper components
  room.tsx                   # Liveblocks RoomProvider wrapper
  convex-client-provider.tsx # Convex provider
src/hooks/
  use-delete-layers.ts       # Custom hook for deletion logic
  use-api-mutation.ts        # Wrapper around Convex mutations with loading states
  use-selection-bounds.ts    # Calculate bounding box of selected layers
src/store/
  use-rename-modal.ts        # Zustand store for rename dialog state
```

### Important Type Definitions
- `CanvasState`: Union type defining all possible interaction modes (src/types/canvas.ts:1-33)
- `Layer`: Union type of all layer types with common properties (x, y, width, height, fill, value)
- `Camera`: Pan/zoom state object (x, y coordinates)

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Input Handling

Keyboard shortcuts are handled in `src/app/board/[boardId]/_components/canvas.tsx:401-416`:
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z`: Undo (via Liveblocks history)
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z`: Redo
- `Backspace`: Delete selected layers

## Data Flow for Canvas Mutations

1. User interaction triggers `onPointerDown`, `onPointerMove`, or `onPointerUp` events
2. Event handler calls appropriate mutation (e.g., `insertLayer`, `translateSelectedLayer`)
3. Mutation updates Liveblocks Storage (layers/layerIds or presence)
4. Liveblocks syncs changes to all connected clients
5. Components re-render via useStorage/useOthers hooks
6. All users see the same canvas state in real-time

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Shape Layer Type
1. Add new enum value to `LayerType` in `src/types/canvas.ts:107-113`
2. Create new layer type (e.g., `CircleLayer`) in `src/types/canvas.ts`
3. Add case handling in `Canvas.insertLayer` mutation
4. Create renderer component in `src/app/board/[boardId]/_components/layers/`
5. Update `LayerPreview` to render the new type

### Modifying Canvas Interaction
Edit the relevant event handler in `canvas.tsx` (onPointerDown, onPointerMove, onPointerUp) and update the `CanvasState` type if introducing new modes.

### Adding UI Controls
UI components generally wrap Radix UI primitives. Add new controls in `Toolbar` or `SelectionTools` components and dispatch canvas state changes via the canvas callbacks.

## Testing Notes

No test framework is currently configured. Manual testing on localhost:3008 after `npm run dev`.

## Deployment

Build process: `npm run build` â†’ Next.js generates optimized production build. Convex functions are deployed separately (see Convex documentation for backend deployment).
